There are several different views as to how faces are perceived. Some think that facial features are viewed and processed as parts but also in relation to one another. Other studies have found evidence suggesting that faces are simply perceived based off the sum of their individual features. In this study, we explore how the brain recognizes particular features and how the omission of certain features, the eyes and mouth, impacts the ability to recognize a face. We looked at this by testing how recognition accuracy differed when these facial features were covered. We found a significant difference in sensitivity when eyes were covered but no significant difference when the mouth was covered, indicating that the eyes are more important in facial recognition than the mouth. 

## Hypotheses
Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in face recognition when nothing is covered, mouth is covered, or eyes are covered 
Hypothesis 1: Face recognition is the best when nothing is covered 
Hypothesis 2: Face recognition is the worst when eyes are covered

## Methods
The experiment was created and run on PsychoPy. The PsychoPy file can be found <a href = "facerecognitionexperiment/experiment/Experiment.psyexp">here</a> and viewed <a href = "facerecognitionexperiment/experiment/Experiment.psyexp.xml">here</a>, and specfics of the experiment methocs can be viewed <a href = "https://facerecognitionexperiment/results/Presentation.pdf">here</a>

## Results 
The data was analyzed using SPSS.
