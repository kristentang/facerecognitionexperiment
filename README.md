There are several different views as to how faces are perceived. Some think that facial features are viewed and processed as parts but also in relation to one another. Other studies have found evidence suggesting that faces are simply perceived based off the sum of their individual features. In this study, we explore how the brain recognizes particular features and how the omission of certain features, the eyes and mouth, impacts the ability to recognize a face. We looked at this by testing how recognition accuracy differed when these facial features were covered. We found a significant difference in sensitivity when eyes were covered but no significant difference when the mouth was covered, indicating that the eyes are more important in facial recognition than the mouth.

## Hypotheses
Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in face recognition when nothing is covered, mouth is covered, or eyes are covered 
Hypothesis 1: Face recognition is the best when nothing is covered 
Hypothesis 2: Face recognition is the worst when eyes are covered

## Methods
The experiment was created and run on PsychoPy. The PsychoPy experiment files can be found <a href = "https://kristentang.github.io/facerecognitionexperiment/experiment/Experiment.psyexp">here</a>. 

## Results 
The data was analyzed using SPSS.The data can be found here and the results can be found here.

The figure shows the mean forced choice sensitivity over the three conditions. In this study, sensitivity is the ability to identify a previously shown face and discriminate between that face and a distractor face. This shows the highest ability to recognize a previously shown face when nothing is covered and the lowest ability to recognize a previously shown face when the eyes are covered.

The significant difference in sensitivity between nothing covered and eyes covered indicates that eyes play a significant role in facial recognition. Since there is no significant difference between the sensitivities for nothing covered and mouth covered, we can conclude that the mouth does not play a significant role in facial recognition. The significant difference in sensitivity between eyes covered and mouth covered indicates that eyes are more instrumental in facial recognition than mouth. From this we also draw the conclusion that the feature being covered, not just the fact that part of the face was being blocked, affected facial recognition ability.
